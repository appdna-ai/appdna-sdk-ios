/// fractional timestamp returns nil. Not "sometimes": every time, for every entitlement, on every build.
///
/// So the one code path that DID read an expiry threw it away, while the other
/// (`BillingModule.getEntitlements`) hard-coded nil. Between them, `Entitlement.expiresAt` was
/// unreachable — a public field of a public type that could not hold a value.

/// Tries fractional first (what our server actually sends), then plain (what a store or a hand-written
/// fixture might send). One parser, one place, both spellings.
