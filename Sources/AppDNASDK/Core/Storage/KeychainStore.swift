/// The identity-persistence surface `IdentityManager` depends on.
///
/// It exists so a test can inject an in-memory double, and that is not a stylistic preference — it
/// is the fix for a test that could not fail.
///
/// `IdentityManagerTests` used to guard its two persistence tests with:
///
///     try XCTSkipIf(keychainStore.getString(key: "anon_id") == nil, "Keychain not available")
///
/// THE SKIP CONDITION WAS THE BUG. If the SDK failed to persist `anon_id`, `getString` returns nil —
/// and the test that exists to catch exactly that SKIPPED instead of failing. The skip is
/// indistinguishable from "this CI runner has no keychain entitlements", which is the normal
/// SwiftPM-simulator path, so the skip was the EXPECTED outcome and nobody looked twice. The two
/// tests standing between us and "identity does not survive a relaunch" were switched off by the
/// very condition they were meant to detect.
///
/// With an injected in-memory store there is no environment to be unavailable, so there is nothing
/// to skip: the persistence assertion runs, always, and fails when persistence breaks.
