/// SPEC-205: Theme variants for light / dark mode.
///
/// Generic wrapper that allows ANY theme-shaped Codable to be specified
/// either as a flat object (legacy — treated as light) or as a
/// light/dark pair. The `light` variant is the complete baseline and is
/// required; `dark` is optional sparse overrides that merge on top of
/// light at render time — any field not set in dark falls back to the
/// light value (mirrors iOS asset catalogs' "Dark Appearance" pattern).
///
/// Resolution happens at render time via SwiftUI's `@Environment(\.colorScheme)`
/// so the SDK auto-adapts when the user toggles system dark mode.
///
/// Back-compat: legacy messages / surveys that stored a flat theme
/// object are decoded into `light` with `dark = nil`. No migration
/// needed on existing customer data.
