/// renewal-retention and churn curves showed subscribers vanishing after month 1 — silently, because
/// `raw.sdk_events.properties` is a JSON blob and a missing event never alerts.
///
/// This observer is the live path's lifecycle emitter. It mirrors Android's
/// `NativeBillingManager.reconcileSubscriptionState` / `diffAndEmit` exactly — same three event names,

///
///   - product **vanished** from the entitlements, previously auto-renewing → `subscription_renewal_failed`
///     (billing retry / grace period), otherwise → `subscription_canceled`
///   - product **still present** with a later `purchaseTime` → `subscription_renewed`
///   - product **new** since the last snapshot → nothing (that is `purchase_completed`'s job — emitting
///     here too is how you get the double-count Android had on its purchase events)
///
/// Triggers, matching Android's: StoreKit's `Transaction.updates` (the direct analogue of Play's
/// `PurchasesUpdatedListener`, but unlike Play's it DOES fire for renewals — `.storeKitOwned` only),
/// app-foreground (Android uses `ProcessLifecycleOwner.ON_START` — it catches the expirations that
/// produce no transaction at all), and, under `.providerOwned`, the provider's own subscriber-state
/// callback via `AppDNA.reconcileSubscriptionState()`.
///
/// 🔴 **Every trigger funnels through a SERIAL chain.** `reconcile()` used to be a plain `async` method
/// with no lock and no in-flight flag, driven from two unsynchronized triggers — and it awaits
/// `Transaction.currentEntitlements` *and* a `Product.products(for:)` NETWORK call before it writes the
/// snapshot. Cold start after a renewal that happened while the app was dead fires both triggers at
/// once; both loaded the same stale `previous`, both saw the later `purchaseTime`, and BOTH emitted
/// `subscription_renewed`. That is an MTPU **over**-count on the single most common renewal case, and
/// MTPU is how customers are metered. Passes now queue behind each other: pass 2 reads the snapshot
/// pass 1 persisted, sees no change, and emits nothing. Serialized — not coalesced: a second trigger
/// still runs a full pass afterwards, because it may carry state the first pass began before.
