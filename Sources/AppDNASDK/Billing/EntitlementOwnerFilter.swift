/// **Why the first-identifier scope on untagged grants**: in v1.0.62 we
/// granted every untagged transaction to whoever happened to be identified
/// at read time (`grantUntaggedMigration` unconditional). That carve-out was
/// designed for one-time legacy migration from pre-v1.0.62 builds, but in
/// SDK-driven onboarding flows where the paywall fires before the host's
/// `identify(...)` call, the resulting transaction is ALWAYS untagged — so
/// every other-user restore on the same device inherited it (the
/// cross-account leak Bogdan reproduced). Scoping the untagged-grant to the
/// first userId ever identified on this device keeps the legacy migration
/// path intact while denying cross-account inheritance for everyone else.
///
/// The "anonymous" branch preserves pre-identify behaviour (a host that calls
/// `restorePurchases` before any user has identified gets every transaction
/// the device knows about — same as before this fix). Once the host calls
/// `AppDNA.identify(...)`, the filter is armed and the per-user binding is
/// enforced on every subsequent read.
///
/// Server-side enforcement (`receiptVerifier.restore/verify` — see
/// `ReceiptVerifier.swift`) is the PRIMARY defence; this client-side filter
/// is a belt-and-suspenders layer for the cached/silent paths
/// (`refreshEntitlementCache` and the bridge's `getEntitlements`/`restore`
/// shortcuts that don't always round-trip the verifier).
