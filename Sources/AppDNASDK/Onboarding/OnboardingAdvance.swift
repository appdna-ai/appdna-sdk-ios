/// Pure onboarding advance state machine.
///
/// WHY this exists: the routing surface (next_step_rules → step / paywall_trigger / analytics_event /
/// end, plus hook-result handling and skip-to) is the most bug-prone code in the onboarding module,
/// and it lived entirely in private methods on the SwiftUI `OnboardingFlowHost`. Nothing outside the
/// SwiftUI runtime could reach it, so it had no test seam and the shared cross-platform fixtures could
/// only assert against a re-implementation of it. The logic below is a MOVE of the host's
/// `advanceOrComplete` / `skipToStep` / `mergeData` / `handleHookResult` / `evaluateRule` /
/// `evaluateCondition`; the host now computes an ``Outcome`` here and executes it.
///
/// Mirrors Android `OnboardingAdvance.kt` (`internal object OnboardingAdvance`) so the two platforms
/// read side by side: same outcome shape (navigation + responses + events + banner).
///
/// Everything here is pure: no SwiftUI state, no event tracker, no delegate. Side effects the host
/// must perform (image-preloading navigation, history push, analytics, flow completion, paywall
/// presentation) are DESCRIBED by the returned ``Outcome`` instead of performed.
///
/// The two "known divergences" this doc comment used to claim were BUGS, and both are fixed:
///   * "iOS does not carry Android's `permission` / `screen` / `sub_flow` graph-node completion
///     markers — iOS routes those elsewhere" — iOS routed them NOWHERE. A rule targeting one of those
///     graph nodes fell through to the next rule and then to plain sequential advance: the node was
///     skipped with no log, no event, no error. iOS now emits the same marker sentinels Android does.
///   * "iOS does not emit Android's `onboarding_flow_completed_via_fallback` event" — the event is
///     actually named `flow_completed_via_fallback` (Android `NextStepRuleEvaluator.kt:293`), and iOS
///     now emits it, so ETL can tell an authored completion from a misconfigured one on both platforms.
///
/// Remaining (real) divergence: iOS pushes navigation history inside `navigate(to:)` (after the
/// decision), so the outcome carries no `historyPush` list; `previousStepId` is passed IN instead.
