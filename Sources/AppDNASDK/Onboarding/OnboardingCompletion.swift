/// SPEC-070-B — the onboarding flow-completion seam.
///
/// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: "the flow finished" is the single most important thing onboarding emits — it
/// is the denominator of the whole funnel and the only moment the host is handed the user's answers.
/// On iOS it was reachable ONLY through `OnboardingFlowManager.present(from:flow:delegate:)`: the
/// event track, the SPEC-088 response persistence and `onOnboardingCompleted` all lived inside the
/// `onFlowCompleted` closure that `present()` closes over, so nothing without a `UIViewController` —
/// no unit test, no cross-platform fixture, no future host-driven presentation path — could reach the
/// completion decision or prove it fired. ``OnboardingAdvance`` had already been extracted for exactly
/// this reason and returns `Navigation.completeFlow`; this is the other half of that seam: what the
/// SDK must DO when it gets one.
///
/// Mirrors Android `OnboardingCompletion.kt` (`internal object OnboardingCompletion`) — same event
/// name, same props, same ordering (track → persist → delegate), so the two platforms read side by
/// side and a divergence has to break a fixture rather than quietly rot.
///
/// NOT `flow_completed`: that name belongs to the SCREENS module (`ScreenManager`), which emits
/// `flow_completed` / `flow_abandoned` for screen flows. Neither platform has ever emitted it for
/// onboarding, and reusing it would silently merge two different funnels in the warehouse.
