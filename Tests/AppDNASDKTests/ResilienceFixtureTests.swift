/**
 SPEC-070-B AC-35 — resilience behavioral fixtures (packages/sdk-shared-fixtures/resilience/).

 These are the upload/queue SURVIVAL contracts, and every one of them lives below the bridge: a
 wrapper cannot observe an HTTP status, a `Retry-After` header, or a prune decision. So — exactly like
 `events` — the category is native-only and iOS + Android assert the SAME fixture table.

 Each `contract` maps to a PURE seam, which is why this is a table test rather than an HTTP mock:
   - transient_status  → `APIClient.transientStatusCodes`  (Android: ApiClient.TRANSIENT_STATUS_CODES)
   - retry_after       → `APIClient.parseRetryAfter`       (Android: ApiClient.parseRetryAfter)
   - stale_horizon     → `EventStore.isStale`              (Android: EventDatabase.isStale)
   - permanent_failure → `APIClient.disposition(for:)` + `APIClient.applyEventUploadStatus`
                                                           (Android: ApiClient.dispositionFor)
   - backoff           → `EventQueue.jittered` / `.retryBaseDelays` / `.maxRetries`
                                                           (Android: EventQueue.jittered / RETRY_DELAYS_MS / MAX_RETRIES)

 `permanent_failure` is the one that matters most, and it is the one that did not exist. W1 was a LIVE
 iOS defect: a single 429 latched `eventUploadPermanentlyFailed` and halted every event upload until
 the app restarted. No test asserted the flag, because no test could — it only moved inside an async
 method doing a real URLSession round trip. Extracting `applyEventUploadStatus` makes the latch
 drivable without a network, and the fixture now pins it: after a 429, that flag reads FALSE.

 A fixture whose `contract` this runner does not know FAILS. It is never skipped — a silently skipped
 resilience fixture is the coverage theater AC-35 exists to remove.

    /**
     `retry_after` needs three states per key, not two: KEY ABSENT (the fixture forgot to state an
     expectation — a bug), KEY PRESENT AS NULL (the header is absent / the delay is refused — a real
     case we must assert), and KEY PRESENT WITH A VALUE.

     A `String??` with synthesized Decodable cannot express that: Swift synthesizes `decodeIfPresent`,
     which maps a JSON `null` to `.none` — exactly the same as a missing key. So `.some(nil)` never
     occurs, the "expected refusal" rows collapse into "malformed fixture", and the suite fails.
     (Android's `JSONObject.isNull` distinguishes them for free, which is why only iOS hit this.)
     `contains` + `decodeNil` is the only way to tell the three apart.
