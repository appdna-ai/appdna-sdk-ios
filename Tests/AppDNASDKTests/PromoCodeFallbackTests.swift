/**
 SPEC-070-B AC-30(b) — *"a paywall with NO delegate REJECTS a non-blank promo code — on both
 platforms."*

 🔴 The bug this guards is a REVENUE path. A paywall presented with no `AppDNAPaywallDelegate` ran

     updateState(code.isNotBlank() ? "success" : "error")

 so ANY non-blank string the user typed rendered "Code applied!", and the CTA path then folded that
 unvalidated string into the purchase metadata as `promo_code` — reaching the backend looking exactly
 like a code the app had validated. Nobody had validated it. The SDK cannot: only the host can.

 Android has proven this since the fix landed, with a Compose UI test driving the real renderer
 (`PromoCodeFallbackTest.kt` — "no delegate - a non-blank code is REJECTED, not silently applied").
 iOS shipped the same fix and asserted NOTHING about it: the decision was inline in a SwiftUI `Button`
 action inside a `@ViewBuilder`, which nothing in this test target can reach. "Android is right" is
 not evidence about Swift — the two renderers are separate hand-written code, and this exact branch
 was wrong on both.

 (`AppdnaPromoDefaultTests.swift` in the React Native wrapper tests the WRAPPER's veto default — what
 the bridge answers when JS never replies. A different thing entirely: it says nothing about what the
 renderer does when there is no delegate at all.)

 The decision now lives in `PaywallRenderer.resolvePromoSubmission`, which is what the button calls
 and all it calls. These tests drive that function, so they exercise the branch that ships.
