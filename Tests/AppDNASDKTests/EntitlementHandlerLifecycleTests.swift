/// (its JS side re-arms the "observer started" latch on `shutdown()` precisely so it will), so
/// `configure → shutdown → configure` ended with TWO live handlers and emitted `onEntitlementsChanged`
/// twice for every subsequent change — after N cycles, N duplicate entitlement grants per purchase.
