 SPEC-070-B W13 / AC-31(b) — *"injecting a paywall/onboarding subsystem init failure leaves ANALYTICS
 WORKING: events still enqueue and land."*

 ## What was missing

 iOS has had `initSubsystem` wired into `configure()` for five subsystems since PN row 17. What it did
 NOT have was a test that ran a `configure()` with a failure injected. `Spec070BNativeAdditionsTests`
 tests the helper IN ISOLATION — it calls `AppDNA.initSubsystem("paywall") { "built" }` and checks the
 return is nil and the error was reported. AC-31(b) rules on exactly that: *"AC-31(a) asserts only that
 the error is surfaced; that is not isolation."* Nothing on this platform had ever asserted that the
 event pipeline survives, because nothing on this platform had ever run a real `configure()`.

 Android proves it end to end (`SubsystemInitIsolationTest.kt` — "every subsystem failing at once still
 leaves a configured, tracking SDK"): it asserts `up["events"]` and then drives `AppDNA.track`. This is
 the iOS twin, and it drives the REAL `configure()` through the same `subsystemInitFailures` seam.

 Analytics is the floor guarantee. The tracker and the queue are wired in `performConfigure` BEFORE any
 subsystem is constructed; a paywall that cannot start must cost the host its paywall and nothing else.

 ## ⚠ Process-global state

 `AppDNA` is a singleton and these tests drive the real `configure()`/`shutdown()`. Every one of them
 tears the SDK back down and waits for the teardown to actually land on the SDK's serial queue —
 `shutdown()` is asynchronous, and returning from it does NOT mean it has run. A test that skipped that
 wait would leave the next `configure()` rejected by the double-configure guard, and the failure would
 surface in some other file.
