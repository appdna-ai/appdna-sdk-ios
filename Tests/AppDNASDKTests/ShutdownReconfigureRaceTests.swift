/// 🔴 `shutdown()` FOLLOWED BY `configure()` ON THE SAME TICK LEFT THE SDK DEAD FOR THE PROCESS.
///
/// `configure()` checks `isConfigured` synchronously under `initLock` and returns early if it is true.
/// `shutdown()` used to clear that flag ONLY inside its async teardown block. So the ordinary
/// sign-out→sign-in / React-Native-reload sequence —
///
///     AppDNA.shutdown()
///     AppDNA.configure(apiKey: …)   // same tick
///
/// ran `configure()` while the teardown was merely SCHEDULED: `isConfigured` was still true, the
/// configure was ignored with a log line, and then the teardown nilled everything. No event pipeline,
/// no billing, no managers, until the process restarted — and no `shutdown()` completion callback to
/// wait on, so a host could not even work around it.
///
/// This drives the exact back-to-back sequence a host issues and asserts the SDK comes back UP.
