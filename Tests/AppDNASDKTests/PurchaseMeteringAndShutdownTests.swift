/// 🔴 TWO DEFECTS IN THE BILLING FACADE, BOTH INVISIBLE TO EVERY EXISTING TEST AND EVERY GATE.
///
/// **1. `AppDNA.billing.purchase()` emitted NOTHING.**
/// `purchase_completed` / `subscription_started` / `subscription_renewed` are the three events the MTPU
/// billing query counts (`COUNT(DISTINCT user)`). Emission was scattered across BOTH layers — some
/// bridges emitted and expected nothing of their caller; others emitted nothing and expected the caller
/// to do it — so three of six cells were wrong at once:
///
/// |                              | StoreKit2  | Adapty    | RevenueCat |
/// |------------------------------|------------|-----------|------------|
/// | native paywall               | 1 ✅       | **2** ❌   | 1 ✅       |
/// | `AppDNA.billing.purchase()`  | **0** ❌   | 1 ✅      | **0** ❌   |
///
/// The zero row is the one React Native and Flutter live on: a wrapper host — or any native host that
/// draws its own paywall — calls the facade directly, on the DEFAULT provider (StoreKit2), and reported
/// nothing at all. Those subscribers were never counted, in our metering or the customer's dashboard.
///
/// **2. `shutdown()` did not stop billing — it could still charge the user.**
/// Every other module facade holds its manager `weak`, so `shared.<manager> = nil` kills the facade's
/// reference too. `BillingModule.bridge` was the SDK's one **strong** facade reference. So
/// `shutdown()`'s `shared.billingBridge = nil` dropped only the SDK's copy, and the facade kept the
/// bridge ALIVE: `AppDNA.billing.purchase()` sailed past its `guard let bridge` and executed a REAL
/// StoreKit purchase, with `eventTracker` already nil so nobody was ever told. A host calling
/// `shutdown()` on sign-out could still bill the signed-out user, silently.
///
/// `subsystemsUp()` could not see it — it had no `billing` key, and read `shared.*` anyway: the shadow
/// copy, not the variable a host buys through.
///
/// These tests assert the OBSERVABLE BEHAVIOUR through the exact surfaces a host uses — they buy
/// through `AppDNA.billing.purchase()` and read the events off the live pipeline. A test asserting
/// "emit() was called" would pass against an emit that reaches nobody, and a test asserting
/// `billingBridge == nil` would have passed throughout the entire lifetime of defect 2.
